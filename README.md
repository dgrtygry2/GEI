# GEI

GEI (Generation engine inputsystem) is a open-source chatbot forked from DAISY chatbot with enhancements. This chatbot aims to be similar to bots such as ("Smarterchild", "Cleverbot", etc) while yet being lightweight and easily compilable and modifiable. This chatbot is a chatbot that so far doesn't have much enhancements other than name changed to GEI and a compile system. More features coming soon though!

GEI will also be hosted online as a discord bot and as a website.

this is a work in progress repo. if you'd like to contribute, please fork. based on GPL 3.
